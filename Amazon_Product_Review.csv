So watching the time is easy.3. The dates of 2 days before and after the present day are shown.4. The day is also shown.5. The holes on the strap give the luxury of reducing or increasing the size of the strap according to the wrist size of the wearer.6. The key used to change the time, day and date is also big enough to operate comfortably.7. Cheap.Cons-1. The strap material is not good.2.
