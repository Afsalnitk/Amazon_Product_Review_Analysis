Great portable touch screen monitor",5.0,"It is a great product and i am fully satisfied till now. It has a touch screen feature if connected to type c cable. It comes with a good quality accessories like PD type c cable, Type A to type c cable, hdmi input (mobile or laptop) to mini hdmi output (monitor). I have ROG phone 3 with Android 10 and it works well with it. I played Call of duty Mobile without any lag when connected with my phone. I also tried Amazon firestick and it works well (obviously without touch because it is connected with hdmi) Few things to note1. Touch screen will only work if you connect with Type C cable.2. If you are android user, make sure you have display out facility in your mobile. One Plus 6 does not have it.3. Touch screen will not work with hdmi cable.4. You won't need stylus because touch works very good. Stylus is not that good as it misses sometimes.5. Keep hdmi cable safe and secure because i could not find any alternate cable in market which has mini hdmi output. All other cables are mini hdmi input cables which goes into your cameras.6. The charger is of 60 Watts but the monitor requires only 10 watts. Rest all 50 watt will go to your mobile or laptop for charging which is great.7. Sound is not good. Who expects great sound from monitor. You can connect to 3.5 Jack if you want. You will connect this monitor with either mobile or computer which already has Bluetooth, and 3.5 Jack.8. Menu is not great but it is fine as it gets the job done.9. Build quality is good with aluminium back plate.10. If you need it for gaming, graphic designing, then don't go for it as it is only 60hz monitor with not accurate color rendering.

Great portable touch screen monitor",5.0,"It is a great product and i am fully satisfied till now. It has a touch screen feature if connected to type c cable. It comes with a good quality accessories like PD type c cable, Type A to type c cable, hdmi input (mobile or laptop) to mini hdmi output (monitor). I have ROG phone 3 with Android 10 and it works well with it. I played Call of duty Mobile without any lag when connected with my phone. I also tried Amazon firestick and it works well (obviously without touch because it is connected with hdmi) Few things to note1. Touch screen will only work if you connect with Type C cable.2. If you are android user, make sure you have display out facility in your mobile. One Plus 6 does not have it.3. Touch screen will not work with hdmi cable.4. You won't need stylus because touch works very good. Stylus is not that good as it misses sometimes.5. Keep hdmi cable safe and secure because i could not find any alternate cable in market which has mini hdmi output. All other cables are mini hdmi input cables which goes into your cameras.6. The charger is of 60 Watts but the monitor requires only 10 watts. Rest all 50 watt will go to your mobile or laptop for charging which is great.7. Sound is not good. Who expects great sound from monitor. You can connect to 3.5 Jack if you want. You will connect this monitor with either mobile or computer which already has Bluetooth, and 3.5 Jack.8. Menu is not great but it is fine as it gets the job done.9. Build quality is good with aluminium back plate.10. If you need it for gaming, graphic designing, then don't go for it as it is only 60hz monitor with not accurate color rendering.

Great portable touch screen monitor",5.0,"It is a great product and i am fully satisfied till now. It has a touch screen feature if connected to type c cable. It comes with a good quality accessories like PD type c cable, Type A to type c cable, hdmi input (mobile or laptop) to mini hdmi output (monitor). I have ROG phone 3 with Android 10 and it works well with it. I played Call of duty Mobile without any lag when connected with my phone. I also tried Amazon firestick and it works well (obviously without touch because it is connected with hdmi) Few things to note1. Touch screen will only work if you connect with Type C cable.2. If you are android user, make sure you have display out facility in your mobile. One Plus 6 does not have it.3. Touch screen will not work with hdmi cable.4. You won't need stylus because touch works very good. Stylus is not that good as it misses sometimes.5. Keep hdmi cable safe and secure because i could not find any alternate cable in market which has mini hdmi output. All other cables are mini hdmi input cables which goes into your cameras.6. The charger is of 60 Watts but the monitor requires only 10 watts. Rest all 50 watt will go to your mobile or laptop for charging which is great.7. Sound is not good. Who expects great sound from monitor. You can connect to 3.5 Jack if you want. You will connect this monitor with either mobile or computer which already has Bluetooth, and 3.5 Jack.8. Menu is not great but it is fine as it gets the job done.9. Build quality is good with aluminium back plate.10. If you need it for gaming, graphic designing, then don't go for it as it is only 60hz monitor with not accurate color rendering.

Great portable touch screen monitor",5.0,"It is a great product and i am fully satisfied till now. It has a touch screen feature if connected to type c cable. It comes with a good quality accessories like PD type c cable, Type A to type c cable, hdmi input (mobile or laptop) to mini hdmi output (monitor). I have ROG phone 3 with Android 10 and it works well with it. I played Call of duty Mobile without any lag when connected with my phone. I also tried Amazon firestick and it works well (obviously without touch because it is connected with hdmi) Few things to note1. Touch screen will only work if you connect with Type C cable.2. If you are android user, make sure you have display out facility in your mobile. One Plus 6 does not have it.3. Touch screen will not work with hdmi cable.4. You won't need stylus because touch works very good. Stylus is not that good as it misses sometimes.5. Keep hdmi cable safe and secure because i could not find any alternate cable in market which has mini hdmi output. All other cables are mini hdmi input cables which goes into your cameras.6. The charger is of 60 Watts but the monitor requires only 10 watts. Rest all 50 watt will go to your mobile or laptop for charging which is great.7. Sound is not good. Who expects great sound from monitor. You can connect to 3.5 Jack if you want. You will connect this monitor with either mobile or computer which already has Bluetooth, and 3.5 Jack.8. Menu is not great but it is fine as it gets the job done.9. Build quality is good with aluminium back plate.10. If you need it for gaming, graphic designing, then don't go for it as it is only 60hz monitor with not accurate color rendering.

Great portable touch screen monitor",5.0,"It is a great product and i am fully satisfied till now. It has a touch screen feature if connected to type c cable. It comes with a good quality accessories like PD type c cable, Type A to type c cable, hdmi input (mobile or laptop) to mini hdmi output (monitor). I have ROG phone 3 with Android 10 and it works well with it. I played Call of duty Mobile without any lag when connected with my phone. I also tried Amazon firestick and it works well (obviously without touch because it is connected with hdmi) Few things to note1. Touch screen will only work if you connect with Type C cable.2. If you are android user, make sure you have display out facility in your mobile. One Plus 6 does not have it.3. Touch screen will not work with hdmi cable.4. You won't need stylus because touch works very good. Stylus is not that good as it misses sometimes.5. Keep hdmi cable safe and secure because i could not find any alternate cable in market which has mini hdmi output. All other cables are mini hdmi input cables which goes into your cameras.6. The charger is of 60 Watts but the monitor requires only 10 watts. Rest all 50 watt will go to your mobile or laptop for charging which is great.7. Sound is not good. Who expects great sound from monitor. You can connect to 3.5 Jack if you want. You will connect this monitor with either mobile or computer which already has Bluetooth, and 3.5 Jack.8. Menu is not great but it is fine as it gets the job done.9. Build quality is good with aluminium back plate.10. If you need it for gaming, graphic designing, then don't go for it as it is only 60hz monitor with not accurate color rendering.
